# Exciting News! 🌟

"The Visit" has been a dream game of mine, and I'm thrilled to announce that the first part is almost complete! 🚀 I can't wait to share it with you all on Roblox in just a few weeks. Stay tuned for the adventure! 🎮✨
### 🎮 My Journey in Roblox Game Development


#### 🛋️ Setting the Scene:
It all started during the pandemic. Picture this: a 13-year-old, bored at home, looking for something fun to do. That's me. My friends and I were deeply immersed in playing games on Roblox. We explored various worlds, completed challenges, and had tons of fun.

#### 💡 The Spark:

One day, a thought crossed my mind: "What if I could create my own game?" At first, coding seemed like an alien language, boring and complicated. But with time on my hands and a desire to create something unique, I decided to give it a shot. I began learning Lua, the scripting language used in Roblox.

#### 🧩 The Learning Curve:

Learning Lua was like solving a puzzle. The more pieces I put together, the clearer the picture became. I started small, creating obstacle courses (obbies) and minigames. Each successful project fueled my excitement and confidence.

#### 🎭 A Twist in the Tale:

Just as I was getting into the groove of game development, my friends and I discovered story games on Roblox. We were hooked! Games like Pet Story, Break In, Break In 2, and the Airplane series captivated us. This new genre sparked a fresh wave of inspiration in me. I thought, "I can create a story game too!"

#### 🚀 The Journey Begins:

With renewed energy, I embarked on my biggest project yet. I designed my first few builds and managed to complete 50% of the first part of my story game. However, as the world returned to normal, school and other commitments took over, and I had to pause my work.

#### 🔄 The Comeback:

Fast forward to 2023. The passion for my game never really faded. With a new system and a fresh mindset, I decided to rebuild everything from scratch. The progress was amazing! But then came the stress of 11th grade, and once again, I had to put my project on hold.

#### 🔥 The Final Push:

Despite the challenges, I never gave up. Whenever I found free time, I dived back into development. Slowly but surely, my game started to take shape. With encouragement from friends and a burst of motivation, I pushed through and completed my game.

#### 🏆 The Outcome:

Now, here I am, almost done with my creation. Looking back, it's been an incredible journey. From a bored 13-year-old to a nearly finished game developer, I've learned so much and had a blast along the way.

 Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences! Let's keep the inspiration and creativity flowing.




## ✨Scraped Ideas: A Treasure Trove of Creativity!✨
When I started creating, I had a lot of ideas which I will be discussing now.

### 1)🌟 The Epic Tale of Multiple Storylines 🌟


Initially, I had an idea to incorporate multiple storylines into the game, potentially leading to over 70 unique endings. Only one of these would have been the origin story. This concept promised a rich and immersive experience but required an entirely new system to implement. Due to the complexity and time constraints, I had to scrap this idea.

### 2)🎮 Solo Adventures: The Single Player Dream 🎮

While developing the game, I considered making it a single-player experience, where players would interact with NPCs and make their own choices rather than playing with others. However, this idea was scrapped for two main reasons. First, to keep it interesting, I would have needed to create multiple storylines. Second, the original vision for the game was to play with friends, not alone.


## Thank You🫂

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope you've enjoyed hearing about it as much as I've enjoyed sharing it with you. At the end of the day, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has encouraged and motivated me to bring this game to life. Your support has been invaluable, and I couldn't have done it without you. Here's to all of us, and to the endless possibilities that lie ahead! 🌟
