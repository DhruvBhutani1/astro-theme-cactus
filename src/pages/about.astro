		<p>ðŸš€ Hey there, I'm Dhruvâ€”your friendly neighborhood coding whiz with a heart of gold and a knack for adventure! ðŸŒŸ:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Coding isn't just a hobby for me; it's my passion, my fuel, my ticket to a state of blissful flow where time seems to stand still. I've dabbled in a variety of languagesâ€”from Lua and HTML to CSS and Pythonâ€”and each one has brought its own unique flavor to my coding journey.</li><br>
			<li>I thrive on challenges, always eager to push my boundaries and learn something new. Whether it's mastering a fresh programming language or diving headfirst into complex projects, I'm a quick learner with an insatiable appetite for growth.</li><br>
			<li>Ah, Luaâ€”the language that kickstarted it all for me! It was Lua that introduced me to the exciting world of game development on Roblox. I poured my heart and soul into crafting virtual worlds and interactive experiences, though, I must admit, some projects fell victim to my old friend, laziness.</li><br>
			<li>But hey, it's not all about coding prowess. People often tell me I've got a kind heart, and I couldn't agree more. I find joy in serving others and believe that life is meant to be lived with a dash of fun and laughter.</li><br>
			<li>So, as I continue to conquer coding challenges and spread kindness wherever I go, one thing's for sure: the world is a brighter, more exciting place with me in it! ðŸŒˆâœ¨</li><br>
